## How to use the project

The project contains several necessary folders. **public** contains the main index file that all the app runs from. The **src** folder contains the **components** folder that holds all the components running our SPA. We also have a CSS folder that holds **SASS** files ment for styling our components. The db.json file is a copy of our local server that holds all the patients data.
